_genre.generator.ipynb_ contains code for a supervised learning NLP model that uses Pythonâ€™s _pandas_, _nltk_, _sk-learn_ and various libraries to perform ML tasks on film dialogues (open the file via JupyterNotebook)

Methods used to facilitate the machine learning procedures include tokenization, dimensionality reduction, TFIDF, cross-validation, grid search, and decision tree classifiers

The data that's being modeled on are 100,000 lines of film dialogues with associated genres from Cornell's Movie Dialogue Corpus, contained in the file _dialogue.db_

The **GOAL** of this project is to predictively analyze new input film dialogues/action lines and associate them with distinguished genre types (horror, sci-fi, action, etc.) It is a piece of the puzzle, a first step in automating virtual film production

_Save_OptimalModel.ipynb_ branches from the main _genre.generator.ipynb_ code. It serializes an optimal model using the identified set of hyper-parameters from the main code in a file named _CinemAiModel.joblib_ using the joblib library

_Load_OptimalModel.ipynb_ branches from the main _genre.generator.ipynb_ code. It deserializes the optimal model by reading _CinemAiModel.joblib_ to predict user inputs. The environment must be set with the same libraries and custom functions to ensure this environment mirrors the training environment _CinemAiModel.joblib_  was serialized on
