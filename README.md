_genre.generator.ipynb_ contains code for a supervised learning NLP model that uses Pythonâ€™s _pandas_ and _sk-learn_ libraries to perform ML tasks on film dialogues (open the file via JupyterNotebook)

Methods used to facilitate the machine learning procedures include **tokenization**, **dimensionality reduction**, **TFIDF**, **cross-validation**, **grid search**, and **decision tree classifiers**

The data that's being modeled on are **100,000** lines of film dialogues with associated genres from Cornell's Movie Dialogue Corpus, contained in the file _dialogue.db_

The **GOAL** of this project is to **predictively analyze** new input **film dialogues/action lines** and **associate** them **with** distinguished **genre types** (horror, sci-fi, action, etc.) It is a piece of the puzzle, a first step in automating virtual film production
