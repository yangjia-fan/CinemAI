genre.generator.ipynb contains code for a supervised learning NLP model that uses Pythonâ€™s pandas and sk-learn library
Methods used to facilitate the machine learning procedures include tokenization, dimensionality reduction, TFIDF, cross-validation, grid search, and decision tree classifiers
The data that's being modeled on are 100,000 film dialogues with associated genres for Cornell's Movie Dialogue Corpus, contained in the file dialogue.db
The goal of this project is to predictively analyze new input film dialogues/action lines and associate them with distinguished genre types (horror, sci-fi, action, etc.) It is a piece of the puzzle, a first step in automating virtual film production
